Firstly, you need four open-source codes loaded from github:
 SC_lio-sam  file_player_mulran  lt_slam  lt_removert

SC_lio-sam:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6DXlC34qlc&t=479s
SC_lio-sam_Relocation: fyx's github
(fyx has wrote a version of SC_lio-sam_Relocation in his github :) !)

file_player_mulran: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU-FC-GmHXA&t=45s
lt_slam: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXBTVurNToU
lt_removert: waiting...


Secondly, you should compile them correctly


Thirdly, you should dowmload the parkinglot dataset(whatever you want, but with revisited parts)
